# Connect-N
Connect 4, but better (and text-based)! 

You can play connect 5, connect 20, connect 1000, or whatever you want! Just change the value for connect_n in the code.

Any problems/suggestions please email tomquincey@gmail.com. Thanks!

*(Works with python 2.7.x, version 1.0 released February 2015)*

### Possible Future Additions: ###

  * Make python 3.x edition
  * Stats page at end of game
  * Add more responses
  * Improve placement of el() and time.sleep()
  * Make player vs computer mode
  * Improve bad use of 'sh', 'cc' as the parameter used in the function as well as variable name (?)
