# Connect-N
Connect 4, but better (and text-based)! 

You can play connect 5, connect 20, connect 1000, or whatever you want! Just change the value for connect_n in the code.

Any problems/suggestions please email tomquincey@gmail.com. Thanks!

(Works with python 2.7.x, version 1.0 released February 2015)
